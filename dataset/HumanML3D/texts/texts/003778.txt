when you are writing something imaginative – such as a story or an account of an interesting personal experience – you can make your writing more effective by including detailed descriptions of people and places. to write effective descriptions, you need a clear picture in your mind of who or what it is that you are setting out to describe. doing this allows you to focus on precise details which make the descriptions come alive in the reader’s mind.good writers incorporate descriptive passages into the overall piece of writing rather than write descriptively for the sake of it. a good rule to follow in writing descriptions is to base what you describe on your own experiences. this doesn’t mean that writers always describe exactly what they have seen or people they have met, but that they use their real life experiences as a basis for their descriptions and then develop them from there#when/ADV you/PRON are/AUX write/VERB something/PRON imaginative/ADJ such/ADJ as/SCONJ a/DET story/NOUN or/CCONJ an/DET account/NOUN of/ADP an/DET interesting/ADJ personal/ADJ experience/NOUN you/PRON can/VERB make/VERB your/DET writing/NOUN more/ADV effective/ADJ by/ADP include/VERB detailed/ADJ description/NOUN of/ADP people/NOUN and/CCONJ place/NOUN to/PART write/VERB effective/ADJ description/NOUN you/PRON need/VERB a/DET clear/ADJ picture/NOUN in/ADP your/DET mind/NOUN of/ADP who/PRON or/CCONJ what/PRON it/PRON is/AUX that/SCONJ you/PRON are/AUX set/VERB out/ADP to/PART describe/VERB do/VERB this/DET allow/VERB you/PRON to/PART focus/VERB on/ADP precise/ADJ detail/NOUN which/DET make/VERB the/DET description/NOUN come/VERB alive/ADJ in/ADP the/DET reader/NOUN writer/NOUN incorporate/VERB descriptive/ADJ passage/NOUN into/ADP the/DET overall/ADJ piece/NOUN of/ADP writing/NOUN rather/ADV than/SCONJ write/VERB descriptively/ADV for/ADP the/DET sake/NOUN of/ADP it/PRON a/DET good/ADJ rule/NOUN to/PART follow/VERB in/ADP write/VERB description/NOUN is/AUX to/PART base/VERB what/PRON you/PRON describe/VERB on/ADP your/DET own/ADJ experience/NOUN this/DET does/AUX mean/VERB that/SCONJ writer/NOUN always/ADV describe/VERB exactly/ADV what/PRON they/PRON have/AUX see/VERB or/CCONJ people/NOUN they/PRON have/AUX meet/VERB but/CCONJ that/SCONJ they/PRON use/VERB their/DET real/ADJ life/NOUN experience/VERB as/SCONJ a/DET basis/NOUN for/ADP their/DET description/NOUN and/CCONJ then/ADV develop/VERB them/PRON from/ADP there/ADV#0.0#0.0
